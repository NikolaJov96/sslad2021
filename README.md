## Exploring the data
Explore the data set by running scripts inside the `exploring_data/` directory.

## Additional experiments

### Pytorch RCNN demo

Pytorch util modules are gathered from [here](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/tree/master/references/detection) and placed in `pytorchscripts/`. Pytorch demo code is downloaded from [here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/torchvision_tutorial.html), slightly modified and placed in `playground/`
